## Backend for a app which allows Anime nerds to meet together and interact together!
so apparently this is a backend rest api for a project i have been working on this basically is like a discord server on stereotypes
it have bots and user authentication users can post different types of matrix (just a fancy name i gave for posts) and users can
join a chat server with different types of rooms and they can join a guild and if the plan goes successfull there will be a yearly guild challenge
and the winner will get a special role for a whole server!

And all the basic functionalities are there too like users can like a matrix save a matrix comment on a matrix and all those thingy although there is no
personal chat functionality right now we are thinking to add it in the near future will see how it goes! users can also rest their password and all those good stuffs
